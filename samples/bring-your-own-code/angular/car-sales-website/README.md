# Power Pages - Bring Your Own Code - Car Sales Website

This project was generated using [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 19.2.14.

This is an angular implementation of [car-sales-website](../../react/car-sales-website/) converted using GitHub Copilot.

This is a modern web application for managing car sales, inventory, and customer information.

## Pre-requisites

Run `npm install -g @angular/cli` to install Angular CLI.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/microsoft/power-pages-samples
    cd samples/bring-your-own-code\angular\car-sales-website\
    ```

1. Install dependencies:

    ```powershell
    npm install
    ```

## Development server

To start a local development server, run:

```powershell
ng serve
```

Once the server is running, open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload whenever you modify any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Angular CLI includes powerful code scaffolding tools. To generate a new component, run:

```powershell
ng generate component component-name
```

For a complete list of available schematics (such as `components`, `directives`, or `pipes`), run:

```powershell
ng generate --help
```

## Building

To build the project run:

```powershell
ng build
```

This will compile your project and store the build artifacts in the `dist/` directory. By default, the production build optimizes your application for performance and speed.

## Running unit tests

To execute unit tests with the [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io) test runner, use the following command:

```powershell
ng test
```

## Running end-to-end tests

For end-to-end (e2e) testing, run:

```powershell
ng e2e
```

Angular CLI does not come with an end-to-end testing framework by default. You can choose one that suits your needs.

## Running on Power Pages

Below steps will help you run this app in Power Pages.

### Setup

1. Install [Microsoft Power Platform CLI](https://learn.microsoft.com/power-platform/developer/cli/introduction?tabs=windows#install-microsoft-power-platform-cli). (Version should be >= 1.44.2)
